This project contains MATLAB scripts to simulate evolutionary dynamics in populations. The scripts calculate the fixation probability of different strategies (mutant vs. wild-type) under fluctuating environmental conditions, and display the results as heatmaps.

Scripts

1. Pure Strategy
Models a population with fixed mutation rates and fluctuating environments. The script calculates how likely a mutation will spread through the population.

2. Bet-hedging Strategy
Simulates a population where individuals adopt bet-hedging strategies based on environmental changes. The script calculates the fixation probability under various parameter values.

3. Responsive Switching
Simulates population dynamics where individuals respond to environmental changes by switching strategies. The simulation calculates the fixation probabilities of different strategies.

4. Stochastic Switching
Models a more complex switching behavior where individuals may switch between strategies based on random processes and environmental states.

Usage

1. Open the MATLAB script.

2. Modify the parameters as needed (e.g., population size, environment switching rates).

3. Run the script to generate a heatmap of fixation probabilities.
