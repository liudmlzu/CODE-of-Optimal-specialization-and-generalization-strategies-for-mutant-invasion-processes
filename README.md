This project contains MATLAB scripts to simulate evolutionary dynamics in populations. The scripts calculate the fixation probability of different strategies (mutant vs. wild-type) under fluctuating environmental conditions, and display the results as heatmaps.



Usage

1. Open the MATLAB script.

2. Modify the parameters as needed (e.g., population size, environment switching rates).

3. Run the script to generate a heatmap of fixation probabilities.
